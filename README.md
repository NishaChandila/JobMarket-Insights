# Job Market Analysis Project

## **Introduction**

My project focuses on **Job Market Analysis**, where I analyze trends related to job roles, salaries, industries, and company characteristics. The dataset includes key metrics such as average salary by job title, company size, industry, along with company ownership, revenue, and job counts. The goal is to provide insights into salary distributions, job market demand, and how company characteristics impact salaries, helping job seekers and employers make data-driven decisions.

As a data analyst, I first cleaned and prepared the dataset to ensure its accuracy, removing duplicates, handling missing values, and standardizing formats. Afterward, I created an interactive **Power BI dashboard** designed for non-technical stakeholders. The dashboard uses clear visuals like charts, KPIs, and slicers to provide an easy-to-understand overview of job market trends and key metrics, allowing stakeholders to explore the data and make informed decisions.
